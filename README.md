# Behind The Cards
An Exploratory Banking Data Analysis

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigates almost 10 years of transaction (13 million+), card, and user data from a banking institution. Using Python, SQL, and Excel, I have uncovered key patterns in user behavior, card ownership, and potential fraud.

The dataset was provided by Caixabank Tech for the 2024 AI Hackathon.

The datasets were downloaded from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets/data)
